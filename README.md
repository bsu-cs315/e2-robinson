## Revision Report

Style Guide Error:

- Removed the assets folder in compliance with the style guide. 
- I thought an assets folder was permitted for assets relating to the main world, but I was mistaken. It has been resolved and I know for the future.

Web Demo Error:

- Web demo is now deployed off a separate branch instead of from the main branch alongside the project.
