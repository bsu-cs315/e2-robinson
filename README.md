## Report

All essential goals for increment 2 are met with this project.

There are 3 demonstrations of juice, including one that was partially added in the previous increment:
- The jewels expand and emit particles when collected, inspired by the (Juice it or Lose it talk)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy0aCDmgnxg].
- The camera uses linear interpolation (lerp) to create an effect that makes movement feel more dynamic, inspired by an in-class demonstration.
- The player flashes and breifly increases in size when collecting a jewel, also inspired by the (Juice it or Lose it talk)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy0aCDmgnxg].

Proper media implementation is also included, with background music, sound effects, and sprites for the player and environment.
